; NOTE: This program was tested and run on a knock-off 
;     arduino board (IEIK UNO r3). I put the code on a
;     arduino brand board, and the LED didn't flash


ENTRY:
LED_ON:             ; Turns the LED on
  LDI r16, 0x20     ; Set bit 5
  OUT 0x05, r16     ; Write to output
  CALL WAIT1        ; Wait one second
  JMP LED_OFF       ; Turn the LED off
  

LED_OFF:            ; Turns the LED off
  LDI r16, 0x00     ; clear bit 5
  OUT 0x05, r16     ; Write to output
  CALL WAIT1        ; Wait one second
  JMP LED_ON        ; Turn the LED on

WAIT1:              ; Launches a series of nested loops to wait 1 second
  LDI r17, 40       ; Starting a value to be decremented
  LDI r18, -1       ;    The number was chosen via trial and error to make 1 sec
BR1:
  CALL WAIT2        ; Runs an inner loop to waste more time
  ADD r17, r18      ; Decrement r17 by 1
  BRBC 1, BR1       ; If r17 is not 0, keep looping
  RET               ; Returns when r17 is 0

WAIT2:              ; Similar to WAIT1, but with different starting value
  LDI r19, 0        ; This will underflow to 255 the first time it's added
  LDI r20, -1       ;    for a total of 256 loops
BR2:
  CALL WAIT3
  ADD r19, r20
  BRBC 1, BR2
  RET

WAIT3:              ; Similar to WAIT2, but without child loop. 
  LDI r21, 0        ; This is the innermost loop
  LDI r22, -1
BR3:
  ADD r21, r22
  BRBC 1, BR3
  RET

OUT:                ; Rinse and repeat
  JMP ENTRY
